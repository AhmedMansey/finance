  2 - "templates" folder which has the HTML files.
  3 - "finance.db" file.
  4 - "application.py" file.
  5 - "helpers.py" file.
  6 - "finance.db" file.
  7 - this "README.md" file.

* All files were written by Harvard CS50's Tutors except for "application.py" and "apology.html" where only 50% written be them,"buy.html, history.html, quote.html, quoted.html, register.html, sell.html" were created by Me.

##Good Luck!
